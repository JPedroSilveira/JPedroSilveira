### Hi, I'm JoÃ£o <img width="24px" src="https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/v-live.png"/>

I fell in love with computation in elementary school when I started to play computer games. 

Although studying from architecture to web development I am currently focused in PWA development.

Be my guest, know my projects and suggest new ones. <img width="28px" src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/idea.png"/>

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a fan of parallel processing, but my favorite language is javascript
